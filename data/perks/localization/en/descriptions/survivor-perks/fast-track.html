<p>Sometimes the sacrifice of others is necessary to get ahead.</p> <p>Whenever another Survivor is hooked, you gain <span class="md-perk-tier-1">1</span>/<span class="md-perk-tier-2">2</span>/<span class="md-perk-tier-3">3</span> <strong>tokens</strong>. You consume all tokens after a great Skill Check on a generator. Each token consumed grants a <span class="md-perk-value-orange">1%</span> bonus progression for great Skill Checks when repairing generators.</p> <p class="md-perk-quote">"The weak are sacrificed first.
