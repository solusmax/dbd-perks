<p>Your arcane abilities have adapted to The Entity&#39;s Realm after centuries of wandering, granting you unprecedented control over its many devices.</p> <p>After working on a generator for <span class="md-perk-tier-1">12</span>/<span class="md-perk-tier-2">10</span>/<span class="md-perk-tier-3">8</span> <strong>uninterrupted seconds</strong>, press the <em>Active Ability Button 2</em> to activate this perk. When this perk is active, repairing the generator will charge this perk instead of making the generator progress. For each <span class="md-perk-value-orange">1.5%</span> of generator repair, the perk will gain <span class="md-perk-value-orange">1 token</span>, up to <span class="md-perk-value-orange">20 tokens</span>.</p> <p>While this perk has at least one token and you are working on a generator, you can press the <em>Active Ability Button 2</em> to consume all the tokens and instantly make the generator progress by <span class="md-perk-value-red">1%</span> for each token. This perk then deactivates.</p> <p>If you lose a health state while this perk has at least <span class="md-perk-value-purple">1 token</span>, the perk will lose all tokens and deactivate. Missing a Skill Check will also result in some charges lost.</p> <p class="md-perk-quote">"When you look a layer deeper, you realize... everything is connected." — Vittorio Toscano</p>
