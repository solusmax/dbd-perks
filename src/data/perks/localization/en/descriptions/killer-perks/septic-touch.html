<p>The Land of Shadows subsumes all. Healing only delays the inevitable.</p> <p>Whenever a Survivor performs the healing action within your Terror Radius, that Survivor suffers from <strong>Blindness</strong> and <strong>Exhausted</strong>.</p> <p>These effects linger for <span class="md-perk-tier-1">6</span>/<span class="md-perk-tier-2">8</span>/<span class="md-perk-tier-3">10</span> <strong>seconds</strong> after a healing action is interrupted by any means.</p> <p class="md-perk-extra-info">Blindness prevents Survivors from seeing auras.</p> <p class="md-perk-extra-info">Exhausted prevents Survivors from activating exhausting perks.</p> <p class="md-perk-quote">"Do not admit to fear, or pain, or doubt. These are the seeds from which darkness grows." — Otto Stamper</p>
