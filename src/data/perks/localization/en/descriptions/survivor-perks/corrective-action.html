<p>You quickly analyze problems and correct other&#39;s work when they make a mistake.</p> <p>You start the trial with <span class="md-perk-tier-1">1</span>/<span class="md-perk-tier-2">2</span>/<span class="md-perk-tier-3">3</span> <strong>token(s)</strong> and gain a token, up to a maximum of <span class="md-perk-value-orange">5</span>, for every great Skill Check.</p> <p>When a Survivor fails a Normal Skill Check while cooperating with you, 1 token is consumed and their failed Skill Check becomes a good Skill Check.</p> <p class="md-perk-quote">"Can't hurt to have another set of eyes on the problem." — Jonah Vasquez</p>
