<p>When you have healed other Survivors for the equivalent of one health state, <em>Renewal</em> activates. If you are already afflicted by the <strong>Broken</strong> status effect, <em>Renewal</em> does not activate.</p> <p>While <em>Renewal</em> is activated, the next time you are unhooked or you unhook yourself, you are affected by the <strong>Broken</strong> status effect. After a total duration of <span class="md-perk-tier-1">28</span>/<span class="md-perk-tier-2">24</span>/<span class="md-perk-tier-3">20</span> <strong>seconds</strong>, <em>Renewal</em> automatically heals you from injured to healthy.</p> <p><em>Renewal</em> deactivates once you become healthy or if you are put into the dying state before <em>Renewal</em> successfully triggers. You lose the <strong>Broken</strong> status effect.</p> <p class="md-perk-extra-info">Broken prevents Survivors from being healed.</p> <p class="md-perk-quote">"Yeah, that's a no." — Steve Harrington</p>
